A [UIDevice extension](https://github.com/developerinsider/isJailBroken/blob/master/IsJailBroken/Extension/UIDevice%2BJailBroken.swift) to check whether an iOS Device is Jail Broken or not.

Also, don't forget to add "Cydia" in LSApplicationQueriesSchemes key of info.plist. Otherwise canOpenURL will always return false.
